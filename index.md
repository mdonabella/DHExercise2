# In Class Exercise

Scattered responses: This exercise was not too bad but required close attention to detail. I didn't realize how easy it was to edit CSS until this morning, when I saw where Susanna entered code for font and color.  One thing I'd still like to improve on is image sizing and alignment in HTML.
